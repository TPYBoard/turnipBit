Contributing
------------

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve MicroPython on the micro:bit.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people. Get involved!
* This is a new community, so, get involved.

We expect contributors to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of
Conduct: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.

Checklist
+++++++++

* Your code should be commented in *plain English* (British spelling).
* If your contribution is for a major block of work and you've not done so
  already, add yourself to the AUTHORS file following the convention found
  therein.
* If in doubt, ask a question. The only stupid question is the one that's never asked.
* Have fun!
