我们建议您下载并使用 `mu editor <http://codewith.mu/>`_ 当通过这些教程工作时。下载和安装MU的说明在其网站上。
您可能需要安装一个驱动程序，这取决于您的平台（指令在网站上）。

Mu支持Windows, OSX 和 Linux.

一旦安装MU，通过USB接口将你的TurnipBit连接到你的计算机上。

在编辑器窗口中编写你的脚本，然后点击“下载”按钮将其传送到TurnipBit。
如果不起作用，请确保您的TurnipBit在文件系统浏览器中作为USB存储设备出现。

Python是 `world's most popular <http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html>`_ 编程语言。
每天，不知不觉中，你可能会使用Python编写的软件。 各种各样的公司和组织使用Python进行各种各样的应用。
Google, NASA, Bank of America, Disney, CERN, YouTube, Mozilla, 《卫报》——该名单将继续涵盖经济、科学和艺术的所有领域。

例如, do you remember the announcement of the `discovery of gravitational waves <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35552207>`_? The instruments used to make the measurements were controlled `with Python <https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/45g8qu/we_are_the_ligo_scientific_collaboration_and_we/czxnlux>`_.

Put simply, if you teach or learn Python, you are developing a highly valuable
skill that applies to all areas of human endeavour.

One such area is the BBC's amazing micro:bit device. It runs a version of
Python called MicroPython that's designed to run on small computers like the BBC
micro:bit. It's a full implementation of Python 3 so when you move onto other
things (such as programming Python on a Raspberry Pi) you'll use exactly the
same language.

MicroPython does not include all the standard code libraries that come with
"regular" Python. However, we have created a special ``microbit`` module in
MicroPython that lets you control the device.

Python and MicroPython are free software. Not only does this mean you don't pay
anything to use Python, but you are also free to contribute back to the Python
community. This may be in the form of code, documentation, bug reports, running
a community group or writing tutorials (like this one). In fact, all the Python
related resources for the BBC micro:bit have been created by an international
team of volunteers working in their free time.

These lessons introduce MicroPython and the BBC
micro:bit in easy-to-follow steps. Feel free to adopt and adapt them for
classroom based lessons, or perhaps just follow them on your own at home.

You'll have most success if you explore, experiment and play. You can't break
a BBC micro:bit by writing incorrect code. Just dive in!

A word of warning: *you will fail many times*, and that is fine. **Failure is
how good software developers learn**. Those of us who work as software
developers have a lot of fun tracking down bugs and avoiding the repetition of
mistakes.

If in doubt, remember the Zen of MicroPython::

    Code,
    Hack it,
    Less is more,
    Keep it simple,
    Small is beautiful,

    Be brave! Break things! Learn and have fun!
    Express yourself with MicroPython.

    Happy hacking! :-)

Best of luck!
